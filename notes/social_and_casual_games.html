<h1>Social and Casual Games</h1>
<p>Friday 10/15/2021</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stereotype of gamers: alone, serious, isolated</p>
<p></p>
<p>McGonigal: gamers aren't loners, forming real social connections in game</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Words with Friends</h3>
<ul><li>Play games with friends vs play games to find friends</li>
<p></ul></p>
<p>Most videogame revenue comes from casual games</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Destiny vs Angry Birds</h3>
<ul><li>Destiny is more of a "real" game</li>
<li>Angry Birds is more accurate of depiction of actual gamers</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>Pac-Man (1980)</h3>
<ul><li>simple</li>
<li>seen as innovative and approachable (same with Donkey Kong)</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>Tetris (1984)</h3>
<ul><li>runaway hit</li>
<li>demand for games that are pickup and play</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>Bejeweled (2001)</h3>
<ul><li>browser game</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>Farmville (2009)</h3>
<ul><li>casual game</li>
<li>latched onto the explosion of Social Media</li>
<li>games fostering social connections</li>
<li>new kind of sociality</li>
<li>shared connection, shared experience</li>
<li>cross regional &amp; and cross language</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h2>Games and Sociality</h2>
<ul><li><b>Remote:</b> overcomes space and distance limitations</li>
<li><b>Asynchronous:</b> players don't need to play the game at the same time (24 hours to make a move in a chess game)</li>
<li><b>Prosocial Emotions</b>: (gentle) seasing, mentoring, etc</li>
<li><b>Ambient sociablity</b>: aware that others are around and playing but the player is not being forced to interact with them. You are not alone but you do not need to interact with others. Low stakes socialization, socialbility on your own terms. less direct, less real time socialization</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>Games and Sociality (the dark side)</h3>
<ul><li><b>Distance or Remote</b>: can't play local game with same console. must have screen for each one. not designed to be played in one room</li>
<li><b>Anonymity and Avatars</b>: smurfing, saying nasty things to people</li>
<li><b>Unwanted Sociality</b>: people who are predators</li>
<p></ul></p>
