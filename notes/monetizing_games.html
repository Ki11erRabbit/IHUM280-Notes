<h1>Monetizing Games</h1>
<p>Wednesday 10/20/2021</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Basic Models for Monetization</h2>
<ul><li><b>Purchasing the game</b></li>
<li><b>Subscription Model</b></li>
<li><b>Free-to-Play (in app purchases)</b></li>
<p></ul></p>
<h2>Purchasing the Game</h2>
<ul><li>using money from individual sales</li>
<li>on PC you have to deal with piracy</li>
<li>in Sid Meier's Pirates! it asks you a question that required possession or knowledge of the game manual with 12 answers. The game doesn't tell you if you got the question wrong. If you got it wrong, the game would maroon you midway through the game</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>Rise of Mobile Games</h3>
<ul><li>selling really cheap games</li>
<li>$200mil Angry Birds</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>Downloadable Content (DLC)</h3>
<ul><li>purchasing additonal content</li>
<li>makes purchases more spread out</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h2>Subscription Model</h2>
<p>somewhat like arcades although I think that arcades are more like in app-purchases</p>
<p></p>
<h3>MMOs</h3>
<ul><li>meticulously designed world</li>
<li>WoW $15 million a year (I think)</li>
<li>makes sense to only play MMO</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>Fortnite</h3>
<ul><li>buy season pass that gives you cosmetic bonuses for playing the game</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>Xbox Game Pass</h3>
<ul><li>game service that allows you to play games you don't own on your hardware</li>
<li>titles can come and go</li>
<li>service plans on going streaming</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h2>Free-to-Play Model</h2>
<p>financed by in-app purchaes</p>
<p>credit card number becomes the cheat code</p>
<p>usually used in simple and casual games</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
<ul><li>Candy Crush</li>
<li>Clash of Clans ($2.4 million a day)</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>Uncertain Purchases</h3>
<ul><li>loot boxes, gacha games</li>
<li>baseball cards and other trading card games (randomized packs)</li>
<li><b>Whale:</b> slang term for people who spend a ton of money on in-app purchases (also common in gambling)</li>
<p></ul></p>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
<ul><li><b>Middle-Earth Shadow of War</b></li>
<li><b>Battlefront II</b>: Got pressure from fans from a boycott and the loot boxes got removed and Disney revoked the exclusive license for Starwars games</li>
<li><b>Genshin Impact</b>: Can take some time before needing to use loot boxes. Makes it so that every few rolls you are guaranteed something good</li>
<li><b>FIFA</b>: uses a baseball card system. Assemble the best team from paying for lootboxes, Belgium banned minors from the game</li>
<li><b>Overwatch</b>: loot box only is for cosmetics</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>ESRB</h3>
<ul><li>added label for if there are in-game purchases</li>
<p></ul>In-Game Purchase</p>
<p>(Includes Random Items)</p>
<p></p>
<h3>From Ramin Shokrazade:</h3>
<ul><li><b>Intermediate Currencies</b>: gold bars in Candy Crush</li>
<li><b>"Fun Pain" and Relief</b>: so close to winning but if you pay you can continue</li>
<li><b>Skill Game vs Money Game</b>: game that requires skill vs game that requires money</li>
<li><b>Reward Removal</b>: you get a reward every level but if you die before getting to the end you have to start over and lose all of the rewards</li>
<li><b>Ante Game</b>: put in more money to do well</li>
<li><b>Gating</b>: blocking progress with money</li>
<p></ul></p>
<p>Clash of Clans</p>
<ul><li>top players would spend up to $250 a day for top players</li>
