<h1>Althusser's Social Theory</h1>
<p></p>
<p>there is a base and superstructure</p>
<p>the base holds the various cultural values and the status quo</p>
<p>the superstructure reinforces the base</p>
<p>ex: rags to riches "capitalist fairytales"</p>
<p></p>
<p>the real challenge is how to maintain the structure through time</p>
<p>replace older workers with newer ones</p>
<p>education teaches you to replace the old in the structure</p>
<p>school indocturnates you and teaches you real skills</p>
<p>GPA proves that you were able to complete arbitrary challenges</p>
<p>the economy perpetuates itself</p>
<p></p>
<h2>How does Ideology get Perpetuated?</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Repressive State Apparatus (RSA)</h3>
<ul><li>using force to control the population</li>
<li>use of military</li>
<li>court system</li>
<li>governments don't have enough power to enforce status quo through force</li>
<li>it also makes people hate the government</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>Ideological State Apparatus (ISA)</h3>
<ul><li>how the world is supposed to work and people want to obay</li>
<li><b>school</b>: teaches you how to be a good citizen</li>
<li><b>family</b>: influences what you think, behave in certain ways</li>
<li>purpetuate self onto children, child inherits from family (ie grief from being first to go to college)</li>
<li>ISA is not controlled by the government and can change</li>
<li>rival ideoloties can exist</li>
<li>ISA is a place of resistance and fights between ideology</li>
<p></ul></p>
