<h2>Two Major Influences on Role-Playing Games</h2>
<h3>1. Fantasy Theme inspiration for role-playing games comes from J.R.R. Tolkien</h3>
<ul><li>Harry Potter made the fantasy theme popular in mass culture</li>
<li>Before then reading fantasy was seen as counter culture</li>
<li>Hippies were reading Tolkien</li>
<li>Tolkien associated with counter culture movemen in the 60s</li>
<p></ul><h3>2. War Games</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gary Gygax (in Wisconson)</h3></p>
<ul><li>avid wargame player and designer</li>
<li>rules for playing game with medieval miniatures</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>Dave Arneson</h3>
<ul><li>Played Gygax's game with friends</li>
<li>reduced game so that each person playing would control one soldier</li>
<li>wrote to Gygax about his idea</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>Gygax invites Arneson over to show him what Arneson has created</h3>
<ul><li>Together they write the rules of <b>Dungeons and Dragons</b></li> 
<li>They formed their own company to sell it</li>
<li>the game catches on and by 1980 they have made $2 million</li>
<li>many derivatives are developed in response</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>In 1982 There is a Dungeons and Dragons cameo in E.T.</h3>
<p>The actor of Eliot's older brother liked DnD</p>
<p></p>
<h3>In the 80s RPGs are Feared (in the US)</h3>
<p>fear of the occult</p>
<p>movie: Mazes and Monsters, 1982</p>
<ul><li>film about how games can take over life</li>
<li>Tom Hanks loses connection on reality and thinks he is his game character</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>Now in the 201x There is Nostolgia for all things 1980s</h3>
<ul><li>RPGs go from being a "comunist subversion to being a family friendly activity</li>
<p></ul></p>
<h3>Computer Games</h3>

<p></ul></p>
<p>Wendy's Feast of Legends</p>
